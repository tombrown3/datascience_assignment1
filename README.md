Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

The Objectives of Exploratory data Analysis are:
     - To formulate hypothesis and assumptions for our modelling.
     - To check the quality of data for further processing if necessary.
     
Using the "KCSE.csv" data provided 
     - To check features that would aid in forecasting the number of A's
     - To eliminate anomalies or outliers which may impact our memory
     
In previewing the data provided I noticed that it was missing data of four years therefore I sourced out this data and obtained it from "2014 statistical education booklet". The missing data would have reduced the statistical power of the study and produce biased estimates leading to invalid conclusions.

From the data analysis I ascertained that the number of A's and A-'s had a similar trend as observed from the scatter plot diagram and the Heatmap
